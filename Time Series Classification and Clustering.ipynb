    "In a typical classification problem you are given a set of input features and a set of discrete output classes and you want to model the relationship between the two.  There is a myriad of classification algorithms that you could use for this problem - SVMs, Naive Bayes, k-NN, etc.  But what if the input features are not independent such as with time series data?  In this case SVMs and Naive Bayes would not be a good choice since they assume that the input features are independent.  The k-NN algorithm could still work however it relies on the notion of a similarity measure between input examples.  Now the question becomes _how do we measure the similarity between two time series_?"

If you are performing dynamic time warping multiple times on long time series data, this can be prohibitively expensive.  However, there are a couple of ways to speed things up.  The first is to enforce a locality constraint.  This works under the assumption that it is unlikely for $q_i$ and $c_j$ to be matched if $i$ and $j$ are too far apart.  The threshold is determined by a window size $w$.  This way, only mappings within this window are considered which speeds up the inner loop.

In this algorithm, $train$ is the training set of time series examples where the class that the time series belongs to is appended to the end of the time series.  $test$ is the test set whose corresponding classes you are trying to predict.  In this algorithm, for every time series in the test set, a search must be performed through all points in the training set so that the most similar point is found.  Given that dynamic time warping is quadratic, this can be very computationally expensive.  We can speed up classification using the _LB Keogh_ lower bound.  Computing _LB Keogh_ is much less expensive than performing dynamic time warping.
